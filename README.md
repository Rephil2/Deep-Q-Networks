<h1 align="center"> Playing Basic Atari Games with a Deep Q-Network </h1> <br>

## Abstract
Deep  Reinforcement  Learning  (DRL)  has  produced  several successful applications these years.  One of them is trainingan agent to learn playing video games.  Combining the ideas of  Deep  Learning  (DL)  and  Reinforcement  Learning  (RL),DRL is able to address problems with high-dimensional inputs. In this project, Deep Q-Network (DQN) is implemented and tuned to train the agent to play Atari 2600 video games such as CartPole, LunarLander, Pong and Breakout under the OpenAI Gym environment. Particularly, Pong is utilized forevaluating performance of DQN. Furthermore, two other network architectures, Double DQN and Dueling DQN, are also considered and applied to compare the model performances.
