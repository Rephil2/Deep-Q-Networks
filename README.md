Playing Basic Atari Games with a Deep Q-Network


Deep  Reinforcement  Learning  (DRL)  has  produced  severalsuccessful applications these years.  One of them is trainingan agent to learn playing video games.  Combining the ideasof  Deep  Learning  (DL)  and  Reinforcement  Learning  (RL),DRL is able to address problems with high-dimensional in-puts. In this project, Deep Q-Network (DQN) is implementedand tuned to train the agent to play Atari 2600 video gamessuch asCartPole,LunarLander,PongandBreakoutunder theOpenAI Gym environment.  Particularly,Pongis utilized forevaluating performance of DQN. Furthermore, two other net-work architectures, Double DQN and Dueling DQN, are alsoconsidered and applied to compare the model performances.
